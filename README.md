# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Building portfolio layout using the Bootstrap CSS Framework
searched for some pictures first and uploaded them to my portfolio 
after titeling the HTML started with the Navigation bar, 
next I added a jumbotron, got bit challenging as the box contained automatic padding but got it removed with style.css and css.

for my work/ projects section i used 3 cards, one of the images had different sizes than others with support from one of the TA's we managed the adjust the size of the picture according to the other two 

for my skills section I used bootstrap carousal, wanted to try somehing else, to improve my skills and challenge myself, it went well up to adding the text, had to make changes by using ul, instead of the p tag that was included. 

as my contact details i liked to keep them simple as felt the website had enough going on so used bootstrap  card. 

finally for my footer as requested hyperlinks with hover effect.
